# Agile Project Management principles:

- Our highest priority is to **satisfy the customer** through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development. 
- Agile processes **harness change** for the customer's competitive advantage.
- **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must **work together daily** throughout the project.
- Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and **trust** them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**.
- **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote **sustainable development**. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to **maintain a constant pace** indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to **technical excellence and good design** enhances agility.
- Simplicity--**the art of maximizing the amount of work not done**--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.
- At regular intervals, the team **reflects on how to become more effective**, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Scrum
We use the scrum method on many of our time-based projects. It is one of many methods based on the Agile priniples. Here is how it works: 


#### 1.	Project Backlog
A **prioritized list of work** that needs to get done maintained by the **product owner**. 
This is a dynamic list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that acts as the input for the sprint backlog. It is, essentially, **the team’s “To Do” list**.

#### 2.	Sprint
A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to **complete a set amount of work**.  
Two weeks is a pretty typical length for a sprint. All the events — from planning to retrospective — happen during the sprint. 
Once a certain time interval for a sprint is established, it has to remain consistent throughout the development period. 
The development team pulls work from the backlog as there is capacity for it. 
Before each sprint starts there will be a sprint meeting, in which the team decides **who will do what**. 

#### 3. Sprint meetings (stand-ups)
This is a super-short meeting that happens at the same time every few days. Many teams try to complete the meeting in 15 minutes - as if they could do it without sitting down. 
You need to be able to comment on these 3 questions in a 
-  What did I do yesterday?
- What do I plan to do over the next 2 days?
- Are there any obstacles?
