# About Telos
There are many blockchain networks out there - so why do we choose to build on Telos if it's not the biggest, strongest, most famous blockchain?
Good point! However, it's the perfect chain for business solutions, because....
- Fee-less transactions
- 10,000 Transactions Per Second, Pre-Sharding
- Environmentally friendly
- No front-running
- Low-cost dApp deployment
- Proper economic decentralization
- Public testnet operated by BPs
- Support for both Solidity EVM & EOSIO C++

What's more is that Yknot has a very close working relationship with the Telos Core Dev (TCD) and Telos Foundation (TF). 
Our crew have been (and still are) key developers and bug-fixers on [Telos EVM](https://www.telos.net/evm), [Web Wallet](https://wallet.telos.net), [T-Swaps](https://www.tswaps.com), [Teloscan](https://www.teloscan.io), and the new [Open Block Explorer](https://github.com/telosnetwork/open-block-explorer).
We contribute to the [Telos Docs](https://docs.telos.net), and the content for the Telos Knowledge Base](https://help.telos.net).

We also run a block producer for the network - [bp.knot](https://eosauthority.com/account/bp.yknot?network=telos)

It's safe to say we're pretty involved.
